# 🔐 LocationLocked Safe
The #1 reason for crypto hacks is **compromised private keys**. Since 2016, over **$2B** has been lost because of this attack vector.

That’s why we built LocationLocked Safe—a fully trustless, non-custodial Web2.5 wallet, featuring traditional Web2 location-based security with decentralized Web3 tech.

# 📍 What it Does
Our hybrid wallet is a multi-sig wallet that requires the user to be at the physical location where they registered the wallet in order to confirm transactions.

Similar to Web2 login services that notify users if there’s an unusual login at a new location, LocationLocked will only enable transactions if the user is at the original IP address during sign up. This ensures hackers miles away cannot drain wallets, even if they have a private key.

In the case users genuinely want to access their wallet from a different IP address, they’ll be asked a security question (set during sign up).
